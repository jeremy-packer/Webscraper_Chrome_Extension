# Webscraper_Chrome_Extension
This is a Chrome Extension used to help scrape lists from web pages. The extension offers two options for scraping infomration from sites.

(1) Scrape Text
In order to scrape information, a user must highlight an item that is similar to the other items that they would like to be scraped. For example, if a user wants the names of all items listed on a certain Amazon page that user must highlight one example name for refence. Once a name is referenced, the user must then select the "Scrape Text" button to run the scraper. This feature works by class names. Therefore, if a site doesn't use class names to describe listed items, then nothing will display. 

(2) Scrape Images
The scrape image feauture allows users to grab the names of items listed with images rather than text. In order to operate this feature a user must simply press "Scrape Image." This portion of the extension works by grabbing all image tags and the associated alt name.
